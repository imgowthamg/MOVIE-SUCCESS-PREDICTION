(2, 'Mohan Lal', '1', '2020-05-20', 'Trivandrum', '1978-01-20', 'Mohanlal Viswanathan (born 21 May 1960), known mononymously as Mohanlal, is an Indian actor, producer, playback singer, and distributor, who predominantly works in Malayalam cinema. He has had a prolific career spanning over four decades, during which he has acted in more than 350 films. In addition to Malayalam, he has also appeared in other regional Indian films.[2]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMohanlal made his acting debut as a teenager in the Malayalam film Thiranottam in 1978, but the film was delayed in its release for 25 years due to censorship issues. His screen debut was in the 1980 romance film Manjil Virinja Pookkal, in which he played the villain.[3][4] In the following years, he played antagonistic characters in several films and gradually rose to supporting roles. Towards mid-1980s, he established himself as a bankable leading actor and gained stardom after starring in a series of commercially successful films in 1986; the crime drama Rajavinte Makan released in that year heightened his stardom. Mohanlal prefers to work in Malayalam films, but he has also appeared in some Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada films. Some of his best known non-Malayalam films include the Tamil political drama Iruvar (1997), the Hindi crime drama Company (2002) and the Telugu film Janatha Garage (2016).[5][6]', 'Early years (1978â€“85)<br />\r\nMohanlal made his acting debut in 1978 with the film Thiranottam, which was produced and made by Mohanlal and his friendsâ€”Maniyan Pilla Raju, Suresh Kumar, Unni, Priyadarshan, Ravi Kumar and a few others. Mohanlal played Kuttappan, a mentally disabled servant. Due to some issues with censorship, the film was not released on time. It took 25 years to release the film.[3]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1980, Mohanlal was cast in the lead antagonist role in Manjil Virinja Pookkal â€“ the directorial debut of Fazil. The film became a major success.[20] Mohanlal''s friends had sent his application in response to an advertisement released by Navodaya Studio.[21] He auditioned for the role in front of a panel that included professional directors. Displeased with his appearance, two of them gave him poor marks, but Fazil and Jijo Appachan gave him 90 and 95 marks out of 100.[22] In an interview with Reader''s Digest in 2004, Mohanlal said that his looks as a young man might have fit the villain''s image.[23]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1986â€“2000<br />\r\nDuring this period, Mohanlal played very different roles in films "made by the great masters", such as G. Aravindan, Hariharan, M. T. Vasudevan Nair, Padmarajan, Bharathan and Lohithadas.[26] Mohanlal, along with actor and scriptwriter Sreenivasan, who played his sidekick in several films, showcased the angst of unemployed, educated Malayali youth forced to adapt to hostile environments in many realistic social satires,[27] some of which were written by Sreenivasan himself.[28]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 1986, he starred in T. P. Balagopalan M.A., directed by Sathyan Anthikad, for which he received his first Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor.[29] He portrayed an unemployed young man who shoulders the responsibility of his family. His performance in Sanmanassullavarkku Samadhanam as a harassed house-owner won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Malayalam) in the same year. Mohanlal was given the status of a new Malayalam superstar by the public after the box office success of Rajavinte Makan (1986), in which he played an underworld don, Vincent Gomez. He also starred in the tragedy Thalavattom, playing Vinod, a young man who becomes mentally ill upon witnessing his girlfriend''s death. He played Solomon in Padmarajan''s Namukku Parkkan Munthirithoppukal. Mohanlal''s association with Padmarajan was very well noted, because their films told stories which were well and truly ahead of their times and broke many conventional stereotypes prevailing during that time in the Malayalam film industry. In 1986 alone, Mohanlal appeared in 36 Malayalam films.[26]<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2000â€“09<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMohanlal and Madhu at AMMA General Body meeting, 2008<br />\r\nIn 2000, Mohanlal starred in Narasimham, playing a rogue with a good heart.[46] It became the highest-grossing Malayalam film of all time.[47] In the next two years, Mohanlal was typecasted in similar larger-than-life action hero roles in films such as Ravanaprabhu (2001), Praja (2001), Onnaman (2002), Thandavam (2002) and Chathurangam (2002). Except for Ravanaprabhu, these films were widely criticised for their repetitive plots, lewd dialogues, punch lines and male chauvinistic outlook.[47][48][49] A critic from The New Indian Express wrote: "The Narasimham hangover is terrifically strong and it has, at least for the moment, killed the prospects of good films. I don''t see any other reason for the failure of well made female-oriented films like Mazha and Madhuranombarakkattu".[47]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2002, Mohanlal played Sreenivasan IPS, a Mumbai police officer,[23] in his first Bollywood film Company, which introduced him to the Hindi-speaking audience in India and for which he won the International Indian Film Academy Awards (IIFA) and Star Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor.[50][51] The film dealt with the real-life story of two underworld dons who ruled Mumbai (played by Ajay Devgn and Vivek Oberoi). Mohanlal''s performance was well received. The Hindu noted that the actor is "at his natural best" and "does not look stifled or anxious as other South Indian stars do when they appear in a Hindi movie for the first time".[52] In a 2010 online poll by Hindifilmnews.com, Mohanlal''s performance in Company was chosen as "The Finest Performance of a Bollywood Actor in the Last Decade (2001â€“2010)". He was No. 1 in the audiences'' list and maintained No. 6 in the critics'' list.[53]', 'lal@gmail.com', '123', '0.jpg', 0),

Fazil''s screen test of Prithviraj prompted director Ranjith to cast him in the 2002 romantic-drama Nandanam, his acting debut, a commercial success.[5] He established himself as a successful leading actor in the following years. In 2006, he starred in the coming-of-age romance film Classmates, which became the highest-grossing Malayalam film ever. In the same year, he won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor for his performances in Vaasthavam, becoming the youngest recipient of the award at the age of 24. The 2009 action film Puthiya Mukham marked his debut as a playback singer, the film is considered significant in heightening his stardom.

He is known for adapting stories from Malayalam films into Bollywood, from his own work as well as other films. Most notable such Bollywood films include Hera Pheri, Hungama, Hulchul, Garam Masala, Bhagam Bhag, Chup Chup Ke, Dhol, and Bhool Bhulaiyaa.

His most popular commercials are for Coca-Cola, American Express, Nokia, Parker Pens, Asian Paints, Kinley and Max New York Life Insurance.[3]', 'From 1984 to 1987<br />\r\nPriyan continued his fine form for slapstick comedy with the successful Odaruthammava Aalariyam and he later made Onnanam Kunnil Oradi Kunnil and the Mammootty-Shankar family thriller Parayanumvayya Parayathirikkanumvayya. Then he made Punnaram Cholli Cholli, his first film without Mohanlal. His successful stinct continued with Boeing Boeing and Aram + Aram = Kinnaram, both doing wonderful business. He was later criticised for making Rakkuyilin Ragasadassil, a film which was supposed to be made with Shankar and Menaka and many said the lead pair Mammootty & Suhasini was miscast and in spite of hit songs, the film flopped. But Mazha Peyyunnu Maddalam Kottunnu, Ayalvasi Oru Daridravasi and Dheem Tharikida Thom became hits underlining his consistency. Priyan was accepted as a serious director with the highly successful tragic family drama Thalavattam. His Tamil film Chinnamanikkuyile remained unreleased, while his success stint continued in Malayalam with Cheppu being a success.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom 1988 to 1998<br />\r\n1988 was a landmark year in Priyadarshan''s career. He directed Vellanakalude Nadu, based on a script by Sreenivasan, with Mohanlal in the lead role. This film revolved around corruption, land mafia and other social issues. This film ended up becoming the biggest hit in Priyadarshan''s career to that point. Then came Aryan, an action film based on the Mumbai underworld, which completed 150 days in theatres. Chithram, Priyadarshan''s all-time biggest hit, was also released in 1988. Chithram completed 366 days in theatres and created new records in collections, until they were broken by his own film, Kilukkam in 1991. Oru Muthassi Katha and Mukunthetta Sumitra Vilikkunnu completed his 5 releases of 1988. However, he couldn''t deliver hits in 1990 with Kadathanadan Ambadi and Akkareyakkareyakkare. In the year 1991, Priyadarshan brought out Kilukkam with Mohanlal, Jagathi Sreekumar and Revathi in lead roles. Kilukkam broke several collection records and is still considered one of the best films from the Priyadarshan-Mohanlal team. His next three films, Abhimanyu (1991), Advaitham (1992), and Thenmavin Kombathu (1994) successfully completed 100 days in theatres. Both Midhunam (1993) and Minnaram (1994) were able to make good response in cinemas. Meanwhile, Priyadarshan was invited by Shri. M. Karunanidhi to direct a film for his son''s production house. Priyadarshan thus made his Tamil debut with Gopura Vasalile . In 1991 he also made a Telugu film Nirnayam when Nagarjuna approached him to remake his Malayalam film Vandanam in Telugu. In the year 1992, Priyadarshan made his debut in Bollywood with Muskurahat, again remake of his own Malayalam film Kilukkam which ended up as a disastrous flop. In 1993, he made a comeback in Hindi with Gardish, an adaptation of the Malayalam film Kireedom, written by A. K. Lohithadas. Priyadarshan successfully added ingredients required for Hindi audiences and the film was a huge hit, opening the doors of Bollywood to him. In 1994, Priyadarshan directed his second and last Telugu film till date, Gandeevam, starring Balakrishna. He was also assigned the direction of the Miss World 1996 event that was held in Bangalore, which made him a known face around the country. In 1996, Priyadarshan came up with his dream project, Kalapani, an epic period film based on Indian struggle for Independence. With Mohanlal, Tabu, Prabhu Ganesan and Amrish Puri in main roles and outstanding music by Ilaiyaraja, Kalapani took Priyadarshan''s career path to new heights. This film, which was originally filmed in Malayalam, was also dubbed and released in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi simultaneously. Kalapani brought him several awards for the first time in his career. In 1997, Priyadarshan directed two films, Chandralekha in Malayalam and Virasat a Hindi adaptation of Bharathan''s Tamil film Thevar Magan, both super hits. The success of Virasat made Priyadarshan a household name in Hindi cinema.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1998 to present<br />\r\nIn the year 1998, Priyadarshan directed three films, Saat Rang Ke Sapne, remake of his own Thenmavin Kombathu, then Doli Saja Ke Rakhna, with story adapted from Fazil''s Aniyathi Pravu and Kabhi na Kabhi, but all three bombed at the box office. Priyadarshan joined with Mammooty after a long gap in 1999 for Megham. During this period Priyadarshan received a couple of offers from Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna, actors of Telugu industry to direct them, but declined them and moved on to his next Hindi project. In 1999, Hera Pheri was released in Hindi, which for once and all changed the destiny of Priyadarshan in Bollywood. Hera Pheri, an adaptation of the Malayalam film Ramjirao Speaking (1989), was a huge hit at the box office. Starring Akshay Kumar, Sunil Shetty, Tabu and Paresh Rawal, this film is now considered a landmark in the history of Hindi cinema. The film also gave birth to the Priyadarshan-Akshay Kumar team, which in later years produced several hits. After Hera Pheri, Paresh Rawal became another regular face in Priyadarshan films. This film was followed by a series of films in Hindi including Yeh Teraa Ghar Yeh Meraa Ghar, Hungama, Hulchul, Garam Masala, and Kyon Ki. In the year 2000, Priyadarshan directed the Malayalam-Tamil bilingual Raakilipattu (Snegithiye in Tamil) starring Tabu and Jyothika, with story adapted from the Marathi film Bindhaast, an experimental film with all female characters, which was critically well received. The original plan was to release both versions simultaneously, but due to unknown reasons the Malayalam version was delayed and the Tamil version released first. The Malayalam as well as the dubbed Hindi version, Friendship, released only seven years later in 2007.[8][9][10] Priyadarshan''s English language epic period film titled The Last Revolutionary produced by 20th Century Fox, based on the life of Indian freedom fighter Chandrasekhar Azad was supposed begin filming in 2001, but the project was shelved due to unknown reasons.[11][12] During this period, Tamil actor Kamal Haasan was working on his ambitious film, Anbe Sivam. After finishing the script, Kamal Haasan approached Priyadarshan to direct the film. The pre-production commenced; but after some differences of opinion between the director and the actor; Priyadarshan opted out from the project before the first schedule. This sudden setback led to the whole crew to run out of their schedules. Hence, the producers after convincing Kamal Haasan, quickly roped in Sundar.C to direct the film. Priyadarshan made the comedy film Kakkakuyil in 2001, bringing back the old combo of Mohanlal and Mukesh (actor), which was popular in the 1980s and 1990s. The film was a superhit at the box office. But, his two other films in Malayalam, Kilichundan Mampazham and Vettom released in 2003 and 2004 respectively, were commercial disappointments, which made him concentrate more in Bollywood. But at the same time, in Hindi, Priyadarshan continued his successful run with Chup Chup Ke, Bhagam Bhag, Malamaal Weekly, Dhol, Bhool Bhulaiyaa, De Dana Dan and Mere Baap Pehle Aap. But his subsequent films Billu, Bumm Bumm Bole, Khatta Meeta, Aakrosh and Tezz failed to live up to the expectations. His most recent release Rangrezz also failed at the box-office. In the meantime, Priyadarshan stunned everyone with Kanchivaram, an offbeat film that revolved around the weavers in Kanchipuram. Prakash Raj, who played the central character, won the National Film Award for Best Actor in 2008. Kanchivaram also won accolades at several film festivals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPriyadarshan returned to Malayalam films directing the Mohanlal starrer, Arabeem Ottakom P. Madhavan Nayarum in Oru Marubhoomikkadha. The 2013 film Geethaanjali starring Mohanlal as Dr. Sunny Joseph, and the 2014 film Aamayum Muyalum did not do well at the box-office.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn late 2015, Priyadarshan announced a crime thriller film in Malayalam, with Mohanlal in the lead role.[13][14] The production was confirmed and the title Oppam was announced in December 2015. The director started working on the film ahead of another big-budget film starring Mohanlal, which was delayed due to unfavourable weather in Russia, where the film was supposed to be shot.[15] The screenplay and dialogues are written by Priyadarshan himself which is based on the story by debutant writer Govind Vijayan. The film released to positive reviews[16] and emerged as a blockbuster, beating several records[17] and becoming the highest grossing Malayalam film of the year within 16 days of release.[18]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn early 2018, he started pre-production his biggest project till date.

Consider splitting it into new pages, adding subheadings, or condensing it. (March 2019)<br />\r\nOn 24 October 2012, she performed Kuchipudi in the Guruvayur Sree Krishna Temple.[11][12][13] Later in July 2013, she acted in a commercial with Amitabh Bachchan. Her comeback announcement was greeted with much fanfare by fans and the media.[14][15] She later appeared in many advertisements for Kalyan Jewellers alongside Amitabh Bacchan, Aishwarya Rai, Akkineni Nagarjuna and Prabhu Ganesan. She recently published a book titled Sallapam.[16]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe made her return to cinema with Rosshan Andrrews''s How Old Are You in 2014. Warrier played the character of Nirupama Rajeev, a UD clerk in the Revenue Department. The film received positive reviews from critics and was well-received by audiences and it became a blockbuster hit in the Kerala box office.[17] She received numerous accolades and became the goodwill ambassador for many ventures related to organic farming, inspired by her film. Her next film was Sathyan Anthikad''s Ennum Eppozhum which reunites her with Mohanlal after a gap of 17 years.[18] Her next project was Rani Padmini by Aashiq Abu along with Rima Kallingal, released in October 2015. The film did not fare well at the box office as it faced strong competition from other movies like Ennu Ninte Moideen and Amar Akbar Anthony. She acted in Jo and the Boy, her last release of 2015, as an animator. Her first full-length role in 2016 was Rajesh Pillai''s Vettah, a mind-game thriller, in which she appeared in the role of a police officer. This film was a success, and she received numerous awards for the role.[19]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe acted in a Sanskrit stage drama based on AbhijÃ±ÄnaÅ›Äkuntalam. The play was presented by the Sopanam Institute of Performing Arts & Research, founded by the late Kavalam Narayana Panicker, and was hosted by Swaralaya. Warrier debuted as a producer as well and the play was produced under her banner, Manju Warrier Productions.[20] Her next film was Karinkunnam 6S, in which she played the character of Vandana, a volleyball coach which was also a hit movie. She also sang a song for cancer patients for the show she hosted Kerala Can(Manorama News), written by Ratheesh Vega.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer first release in 2017 was C/O Saira Banu where she played a post woman. The film also marked the comeback of Amala Akkineni in Malayalam after more than two decades. Her performance won great critical acclaim and the movie was a moderate grosser.[21] On 28 September, her next film Udaharanam Sujatha released in Kerala. It received positive reviews from critics and a warm response audiences.[22] She received great praise for her portrayal of Sujatha, mother of a tenth class student and a person who does multiple jobs to ensure a good life for her daughter and it was superhit in boxoffice .[citation needed] Her next release in 2017 was Villain, an emotional thriller where she appears as Dr. Neelima, an independent, idealistic woman and wife of Mathew Manjooran played by Mohanlal. The film went on to set the record for the highest first day collections for a Malayalam film. It received mixed response from critics and a positive feedback from the audience.[citation needed] Directors N. Lingusamy, Mysskin, Pandiraj, Thiru, and Suseenthiran were all positive about the film, particularly praising the actors'' performances and the production. Soumya Rajendran wrote in her review for The News Minute - "It''s lovely to see Manju Warrier and Mohanlal romancing on screen. The couple shares a palpable chemistry and the best scenes in the film undoubtedly belong to their shared moments. Although a brief role, Manju lights up the screen and the relationship between them comes across as genuine even though neither character is defined beyond a few broad strokes."[23]<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn 2019, Manju appeared in the lead role in the Kamala Surayya biopic Aami which received positive to mixed reviews. Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News wrote in her review - "Warrier enters the frame much later, but seamlessly takes on the role of a woman on the cusp of a quarter-life crisis. The actress is in total command here. Surayya isnâ€™t an easy woman to play, but Warrier make her eccentricities alluring and charming."[24] Manoj Kumar R of The Indian Express complimented Manju delivered a ''knockout performance'' - "It is, indeed, impressive to watch Manju Warrier play the role of a conflicted woman. Her conviction in the performance is what keeps our attention even when narration loses steam."[25] Her next film for release was the musical-romantic-comedy drama Mohanlal in which she played a die-hard fan of Mohanlal. The film opened to mixed reviews. Jan Varghese wrote in her review for BookMyShow - "Manju Warrier gives one of her better performances to date as Meenukutty. She carries the movie firmly on her shoulders with her almost flawless performance."[26] Her next release was the much-hyped fantasy drama Odiyan, in which she appeared alongside Mohanlal and Prakash Raj sporting different looks throughout the movie. Though the film released to mixed response, the performance of the lead actors were appreciated. In her review for Firstpost, Anna M. M. Vetticad said, "Warrier is uniformly good as the lonesome, long-suffering Prabha who has always known that her fate was written the moment she was born into a particular social class and often summons up the spirit to defy that written word."[27] Odiyan earned the highest opening-day collection for a film at Kerala box office and for a Malayalam film at worldwide box office. Odiyan also registered the highest opening weekend (14â€“16 December) collection for a Malayalam film at domestic and worldwide box office.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHer first release in 2019 was another much anticipated-movie Lucifer directed by Prithviraj Sukumaran in his directorial debut, written by Murali Gopy and featuring Mohanlal in the lead role as Stephen Nedumpally, alongside a supporting cast including Prithviraj Sukumaran himself, Vivek Oberoi, Tovino Thomas and Indrajith Sukumaran. Her performance in the film was considered to be the strongest in recent times with both critics and audiences showering praises. Complimenting her, Soumya Rajendran wrote in her review, "Manju Warrier is blessed with an extremely expressive face, and when she''s upset, you can actually see her nostrils quiver. There''s one scene when her face collapses as she hears Bobby''s (Vivek Oberoi''s) response to a question she poses, and you can see just what an actor can bring to the table when she knows her job."[28] Manjusha Radhakrishnan said in her review for Gulf News - "To watch top Malayali talent Manju Warrier as a grieving daughter of a political leader, who dies suddenly, leaving a political vacuum in her family and her political outfit, is pure gold. Warrier as a troubled mother and wife Priyadarshani â€” who unearths a string of dark secrets within her family circles â€” is heartbreaking. In limited screen-time, she comes across as a paragon of vulnerability and strength â€” an indication to the strength of her acting prowess."[29] She is one of the founding members of Women in Cinema Collective, the organization for the welfare of women workers in the Malayalam movie industry and she was the only female actor in kerala having fans association and wellwishers in International level known as Manju Warrier Fans and Welfare Association International.[30] She made her Tamil debut with Asuran in 2019.[31]', 'manju@gmail.com', '123', '24.jpg', 0),

Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat. Many actors train at length in specialist programs or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMost early sources in the West that examine the art of acting (Greek: á½‘Ï€ÏŒÎºÏÎ¹ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚, hypokrisis) discuss it as part of rhetoric.', 'Conservatories and drama schools typically offer two- to four-year training on all aspects of acting. Universities mostly offer three- to four-year programs, in which a student is often able to choose to focus on acting, whilst continuing to learn about other aspects of theatre. Schools vary in their approach, but in North America the most popular method taught derives from the ''system'' of Konstantin Stanislavski, which was developed and popularised in America as method acting by Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler, Sanford Meisner, and others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther approaches may include a more physically based orientation, such as that promoted by theatre practitioners as diverse as Anne Bogart, Jacques Lecoq, Jerzy Grotowski, or Vsevolod Meyerhold. Classes may also include psychotechnique, mask work, physical theatre, improvisation, and acting for camera.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegardless of a school''s approach, students should expect intensive training in textual interpretation, voice, and movement. Applications to drama programmes and conservatories usually involve extensive auditions. Anybody over the age of 18 can usually apply. Training may also start at a very young age. Acting classes and professional schools targeted at under-18s are widespread. These classes introduce young actors to different aspects of acting and theatre, including scene study.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIncreased training and exposure to public speaking allows humans to maintain calmer and more relaxed physiologically.[2] By measuring a public speaker''s heart rate maybe one of the easiest ways to judge shifts in stress as the heart rate increases with anxiety . As actors increase performances, heart rate and other evidence of stress can decrease.[3] This is very important in training for actors, as adaptive strategies gained from increased exposure to public speaking can regulate implicit and explicit anxiety.[4] By attending an institution with a specialization in acting, increased opportunity to act will lead to more relaxed physiology and decrease in stress and its effects on the body. These effects can vary from hormonal to cognitive health that can impact quality of life and performance', '8124633.jpg', '1.mp4', 'ma@gmail.com', 'antony@gmail.com', 0);

A very sumptuous Vishu sadhya in advance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood characterization and weightage to all. Even for all the supporting cast as well.The film may be bit slow for some.

Acting also demands an ability to employ dialects, accents, improvisation, observation and emulation, mime, and stage combat. Many actors train at length in specialist programs or colleges to develop these skills. The vast majority of professional actors have undergone extensive training. Actors and actresses will often have many instructors and teachers for a full range of training involving singing, scene-work, audition techniques, and acting for camera.', '6309692.jpeg', '1.mp4', '2022-03-08', 'ma@gmail.com', 0),
(2, 'Singing Skills', 'Singing is the act of producing musical sounds with the voice. A person who sings is called a singer or vocalist (in jazz and/or popular music).[4][5] Singers perform music (arias, recitatives, songs, etc.) that can be sung with or without accompaniment by musical instruments. Singing is often done in an ensemble of musicians, such as a choir of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in art song or some jazz styles) up to a symphony orchestra or big band. Different singing styles include art music such as opera and Chinese opera, Indian music, Japanese music and religious music styles such as gospel, traditional music styles, world music, jazz, blues, ghazal and popular music styles such as pop, rock and electronic dance music.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSinging can be formal or informal, arranged, or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort, or ritual as part of music education or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction, and regular practice. If practice is done regularly then the sounds can become clearer and stronger.[6] Professional singers usually build their careers around one specific musical genre, such as classical or rock, although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take voice training provided by voice teachers or vocal coaches throughout their careers.', '4651031.jpg', '1.mp4', '2022-03-08', 'ma@gmail.com', 0);
